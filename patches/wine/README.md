# Wine patches vstenv ships

Patched DLLs that go over the pinned Wine build (see `vstenv/winefixes.py`).
CI builds them with `scripts/build-wine-fixes.sh <wine version>` and attaches
`wine-fixes-<version>.tar.gz` to every release; setup installs the DLLs into
`lib/wine/x86_64-windows/` of the app's Wine, keeping the originals as `.orig`.

## dcomp-steinberg-<version>.patch

DirectComposition for Steinberg's current products. Their GUI library
`graphics2d.dll` (HALion Sonic 7; Cubase and Dorico of the same generation)
creates a DirectComposition device from a **Direct2D** device, asks the device
itself for surfaces and virtual surfaces, and draws into them through
`ID2D1DeviceContext`. Stock Wine's dcomp is stubs; wine-staging's
`dcomp-DCompositionCreateDevice2` set implements devices, visuals, targets and
a surface factory for DXGI devices. This patch, on top of that set, adds:

- device-level `CreateSurface` / `CreateVirtualSurface` (via a factory on the
  device's rendering device),
- `IDCompositionVirtualSurface` (Resize, Trim, per-rectangle BeginDraw),
- a Direct2D device as rendering device (its DXGI device via
  `ID2D1Device2::GetDxgiDevice`), and `BeginDraw` for `IID_ID2D1DeviceContext`
  (a device context targeting a bitmap over the DXGI surface),
- `EndDraw` accepting every factory kind.

The patch applies to a Wine tree with the whole wine-staging set applied (the
build script does that; the pinned Wine is a staging build, and dcomp talks to
its wineserver by request numbers). Regenerate it for a new Wine version by
re-applying the hunks and renaming the file; `winefixes.wine_version()` picks
the asset by the pinned build's version. Written for Wine 11.17, verified with
HALion Sonic 7 on 2026-09-26; a candidate for upstreaming to wine-staging.
